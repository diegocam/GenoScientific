    <h3>Clinical Background</h3>
    <br>
    <span class="bold_font">Clinical Significance:</span>
    <ul class="normal_ul_list">
        <li>Hyperhomocysteinemia is a widely recognized risk factor for coronary artery disease, venous thrombosis, and stroke. It is also involved in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects, 

            stillbirths, and recurrent pregnancy loss. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of homocysteine. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of 

            5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is the major circulating form of folate. Folate is a cofactor in re-methylation of homocysteine. MTHFR gene can be 

            silenced by point mutations. This can result in low folate and increased plasma levels of homocysteine.</li>
        <li>C677T is commonly seen in Caucasians of European descent. The frequency of homozygotes for this mutation ranges from <5 to 20 percent based on population studied. Based on 

            limited data, the frequency of A1298C homozygotes is estimated to be 9% and the frequency of C677T/A1298C heterozygotes is estimated to be 15 to 20 percent. Both C677T and 

            A1298C alleles are found to decrease MTHFR enzyme activity.</li>
        <li>Only C677T homozygotes and 677T/A1298C heterozygotes are associated with an increase in plasma homocysteine levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <span class="bold_font">Reference Range:</span>
    <br>
    <ul class="normal_ul_list">

    <h3>Genetics</h3>
    <br>
    <ul class="normal_ul_list">
        <li>Identification of genetic etiology for persistent hyperhomocysteinemia</li>
        <li>Assess risk of venous thrombosis. With other genetic thrombophilic factors (factor V Leiden or Prothrombin G20210A), detection of MTHFR mutations indicates 

    significantly increased risk for venous thrombosis cannot be excluded.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Indications for Ordering</h3>
    <br>
    The MTHFR mutations result in elevated plasma homocysteine levels which are a strong and independent risk factor for occlusive vascular disease.
    <br>

    Testing for MTHFR Genotyping is recommended for:
    <br>
    <ul class="normal_ul_list">
        <li>Patients with elevated total plasma homocysteine levels.</li>
        <li>Patients with positive family history of arterial thrombosis.</li>
        <li>Patients with documented atherosclerotic (coronary artery, cerebrovascular, or periperal vascular) disease.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Plasma homocysteine levels may be normalized by nutritional supplements of folic acid and vitamin B12.
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Contraindications</h3>
    <br>
    <ul class="normal_ul_list">
        <li>General population screening</li>
        <li>Fetal testing</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <br>
    Hyperhomocysteinemia may be due to inherited mutation in the MTHFR gene, or may be secondary to folic acid and/or vitamin B12 deficiency. Patients homozygous for the C677T mutation have a 60 - 65% reduction in 

    MTHFR activity and twice the plasma homocysteine concentration compared to normal individuals with no mutation. A second MTHFR gene mutation, A1298C is significant in cases of compound homozygosity with the 

    C677T mutation.<br>

    Analytical sensitivity and specificity are 99.9 percent.
