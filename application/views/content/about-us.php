    <br>
    <p>
        Is its vigorous program in the development and validation of cutting edge tests in-house,
        with the goal of translating basic molecular knowledge to the actual practice of clinical
        medicine Both qualitative and quantitative molecular testing is offered utilizing PCR, RT-
        PCR, multiplex PCR, real time PCR and Nextgen sequencing methods.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Genoscientific Diagnostics is helping to lead the way into the new era of personalized
        medicine. We offer advanced genetic testing to health care providers to promote early
        disease detection and to help physicians achieve optimal dosing of critical medications.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Our mission is to develop genetic tests that will become the model for comprehensive
        disease detection and informed treatment, ushering in a new era of predictive, preventative
        and affordable health care. Genetically guided therapy management is emerging as one of
        the earliest and most pervasive applications of personalized medicine. The confluence of
        new clinical evidence and lowered costs for genetic testing provide an opportunity to lower
        the cost of care, minimize adverse drug reactions, and reduce the time to arrive at effective
        therapies.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Our laboratory is CLIA certified (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment). Our
        facilities allow us to provide the very highest in quality testing in the fastest possible
        turnaround time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The laboratory is equipped with automated nucleic acid extractors (Roche Ampliprep
        instrument, Qiagen EZ1 Biorobot) and instrumentation that includes the Roche Cobas
        4800, Roche Light cycler Z480, Magna Pure LC 2.0, Luminex 200, Genmark, Iron Torrent
        and Quant studio 12 icycler iQ and ABI 7000 real time PCR systems, ABI 3100 genetic
        analyzer, sequencers for genotyping HIV and HCV and routine thermocyclers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Oncology testing includes assays for fusion gene/transcript detection and quantitation.
        The laboratory performed about 2,000 molecular tests a year with the continual addition of
        new tests and participates in collaborative research with the aim of developing molecular
        tests for clinical applications. Our primary focus is to provide high complexity, cancer
        and non cancer -related laboratory testing services to hospitals, community-based
        pathology practices, and clinicians throughout the United States. We currently perform
        analyses for hematopoietic cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma (blood and lymphoid
        tumors) and solid tumor cancers such as breast, lung, colon, and bladder cancer. For
        hematopoietic cancers, we typically analyze bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood
        specimens. For solid tumor cancers, we typically analyze tissue samples or urine.
